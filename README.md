# Cataract Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project aims to detect cataracts in retinal images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built with Keras. The CNN analyzes retinal images and predicts whether the patient has cataracts or not.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python (>=3.6)
- TensorFlow
- Keras

### Dataset

You need a labeled dataset of retinal images. Each image should be categorized as either "cataract" or "normal". The dataset should be split into training, validation, and test sets. The images are downloaded from the Kaggle website.

### Model Architecture
The CNN model is designed to learn features from retinal images for cataract detection. The architecture includes convolutional layers for feature extraction, max pooling layers for downsampling, and fully connected layers for classification.
